### 1. The Dilemma

This year has witnessed the remarkable rise of cryptocurrency prices, ICOs and blockchain projects. Volatility hinders the Cryptocurrency markets making it hard to participate in the space without emotion for many retail investors. There is no doubt that the amount of news appearing in the media regarding Bitcoin has been rising exponentially, both good and bad. With all this excessive exposure comes the injection of fear into the crypto markets.

### 3. Investment Methods, Strategy and VICO Edge

```
1. Projects which pass our verification criteria and have a disruptive blockchain model.
2. Early-bird investment opportunities from trusted parties.
3. In-house developed profitable business ventures within the crypto-space.
4. Derivatives volatility trading.
```

Each Investment Method is a Hedge to prevent loss in a certain sector.

#### 3.1 The VICO Edge

VICO Capital understands the importance of timing, capital and execution. Unlike many other funds, which use the typical diversification model or fundamental analysis for making "educated" investments, these are not recession proof strategies. The VICO approach is more sophisticated than traditional funds, and combines well experienced traders with blockchain specific investors.

### Risk Management

VICO Capital will utilize an in-house risk management technique to prevent catastrophic loss while having a well balanced and profitable portfolio.

1. Unused liquid funds will be stored on hardware wallets.
2. Funds being actively traded will be distributed across multiple exchanges to minimize external third party risk.
3. Short term hold strategy will be in place for the majority of holdings and profit taking will be frequent. This is to ensure we have enough funds available to accommodate a healthy liquidity pool when investors want to pull our their capital.
4. Long-term investments will be coordinated with the amount of capital available. Raises or contracts will be in place if or when needed.

### The VICO Token

VICO operates as an I Owe You (or interest bearing loan between the lender and VICO Capital). It cannot be traded on a secondary market nor can it appreciate in value. At the end of the contract VICO is obligated to buy back the token for the same value paid. Whomever possesses the token in between will be entitled to interest based on the funds performance and contract expiry.

Token Maximum Supply: 4,000,000

### Variable Interest Rate
The interest rate is based on the funds performance and will vary year after year.
```
i = interest (percentage)
t = contract time-lock (years)
p = overall fund performance (in percentage)

i = p/100 * (0.6) + (0.0t * 2)

Eg.

t = 1 year
p = 200%

i = 200/100 * (0.6) + (0.01 * 2)
```
