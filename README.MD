# 1. The Dilemma

This year has witnessed the remarkable rise of cryptocurrency prices, ICOs and blockchain projects. Volatility hinders the Cryptocurrency markets making it hard to participate in the space without emotion for many retail investors. There is no doubt that the amount of news appearing in the media regarding Bitcoin has been rising exponentially, both good and bad. With all this excessive exposure comes the injection of fear into the crypto markets.

### 1.1 Traditional Diversification

#### "Diversification"

A word which makes investors feel warm, fuzzy and safe.

A diversified investment portfolio “may provide the potential to improve [risk-adjusted] returns,” fund giant Fidelity Investments explained to its investors. They included several nice looking pie charts showing stocks balanced against cash, bonds and many foreign securities. A well-diversified portfolio, Fidelity said, would comprise, “ideally, assets whose returns move in the opposite direction.”

The carnage and bubble of 2008 should have taught many investors just how inefficient the diversification model really is. Legions of seemingly well-diversified investors, both big and small alike — found that they had failed to diversify their way out of a total financial crisis. Devastating crashes can occur in any market at anytime.

Traditional funds invest all money and diversify into multiple assets as their risk mitigation.

VICO Capital's unique framework aims to provide solutions for market volatility, achieving profitability in both bull/bear markets and blockchain project funding using its proprietary hybrid intelligence model.

### 2.2 The VICO Edge

VICO Capital understands the importance of timing, capital and execution. Unlike many other funds, which use the typical diversification model or fundamental analysis for making "educated" investments, these are not recession proof strategies. The VICO approach is more sophisticated than traditional funds, and combines well experienced traders with blockchain specific investors.

### 2.3 Risk Management

VICO Capital will utilize an in-house risk management technique to prevent catastrophic loss while having a well balanced and profitable portfolio.

1. Unused liquid funds will be stored offline.
2. Funds being actively invested will be distributed across multiple exchanges to minimize external third party risk.
3. Short term hold strategy will be in place for the majority of holdings and profit taking will be frequent. This is to ensure we have enough funds available to accommodate a healthy liquidity pool when investors want to pull our their capital.
4. Long-term investments will be coordinated with the amount of capital available. Raises or contracts will be in place if or when needed.

# 3. The VICO Capital Token (VCAP)

"VCAP" is the native token for VICO Capital. Only select individuals will be able to acquire them and they are non-transferable.

### 3.1 Understanding VCAP

VICO operates as an I Owe You (or interest bearing loan between the lender and VICO Capital). It cannot be traded on a secondary market nor can it appreciate in value. At the end of the contract VICO is obligated to buy back the token for the same value paid. Whomever possesses the token in between will be entitled to interest based on the funds performance and contract expiry.

At the end of the contract, the token holder has the opportunity to sell the token back to VICO Capital or choose to renew it.

### 3.2 Token Supply

````
Token Maximum Supply: 4,000,000
Token Symbol: VCAP
Token Value: $1.00 USD
````

# 4. Variable Interest Rate

The interest rate is based on the funds performance and will vary year after year.

```
i = interest (percentage)
t = contract time-lock (years)
p = overall fund performance (in percentage)

i = p/100 * (0.6) + (0.0t * 2)

Eg.

t = 1 year
p = 200%

i = 200/100 * (0.6) + (0.01 * 2)
```

Longer term contracts will enjoy a higher % of return as it will allow the liquidity pool to be much larger.

### 4.2 Reporting

Reports will be sent to token holders every quarter and be available on their dashboard.
