### Abstract
The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency market gives entrepreneurs the potential to create disruptive technology while enabling volatility traders exploit swing trading. This combination of investment tactics allow specialized fund managers to yield above industry average gains. Incorporating these investment opportunities with exclusive partnerships give VICO the edge it needs to grow into one of the largest firms in the industry. Whether the market is in an uptrend or downtrend, our firm is able to make the most from any situation.
### 1. The Dilemma
This year has witnessed the remarkable rise of cryptocurrency prices, ICOs and blockchain projects. Volatility hinders the Cryptocurrency markets making it hard to participate in the space without emotion for many retail investors. There is no doubt that the amount of news appearing in the media regarding Bitcoin has been rising exponentially. With all this excessive exposure comes the injection of fear into newcomers.
### 2. The Solution
VICO Capital's unique framework aims to provide solutions for market volatility, both bull/bear markets, blockchain business funding and project screening using its proprietary hybrid intelligence model. All this while delivering above industry average returns in any market condition.

### Investment Method and Strategy
```
1. Projects which pass our verification criteria and have a disruptive blockchain model.
2. Early-bird investment opportunities from trusted parties.
3. In-house developed profitable business ventures.
4. Derivatives volatility trading.
```
### The VICO Edge
VICO Capital understands the importance of timing, capital and execution. Unlike many other funds, which use the typical diversification model or fundamental analysis for making "educated" investments, these are not recession proof strategies. The VICO approach is more sophisticated than traditional funds, and combines well experienced traders with blockchain specific investors.

### Risk Management
VICO Capital will utilize an in-house risk management technique to prevent catastrophic loss while having a well balanced and profitable portfolio.
1. Unused liquid funds will be stored on hardware wallets.
2. Funds being actively traded will be distributed across multiple exchanges to minimize external third party risk.
3. Short term hold strategy will be in place for the majority of holdings and profit taking will be frequent. This is to ensure we have enough funds available to accommodate a healthy liquidity pool when investors want to pull our their capital.
4. Long-term investments will be coordinated with the amount of capital available. Raises or contracts will be in place if or when needed.

### The VICO Token
VICO operates as an I Owe You (or interest bearing loan between the lender and VICO Capital). It cannot be traded nor can it appreciate in value. At the end of the contract VICO is obligated to buy back the token for the same value paid. Whomever possesses the token in between will be entitled to interest based on the funds performance and contract expiry.

### Variable Interest Rate
The interest rate is based on the funds performance and will vary year after year.
```
i = interest (percentage)
t = contract time-lock (years)
p = overall fund performance (in percentage)

i = p/100 * (0.6) + (0.0t * 2)

Eg.

t = 1 year
p = 200%

i = 200/100 * (0.6) + (0.01 * 2)
```
